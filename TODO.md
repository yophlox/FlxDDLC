# FINAL TODOS FOR FlxDDLC

* Choices

* The Doki's sprites (and chibi sprites)

* Finish up the Main Menu

* Fix the Warning screen to work with the newer version of the Dialogue System

* Poem MiniGame (can't wait to make this run off of HScript too)

That SHOULD be all. (I'm not adding any of the secret poem shit or the ghost stuff lol, just the basic shii)
