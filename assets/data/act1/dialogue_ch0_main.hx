showDialogue("", "We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up.");

showDialogue("", "But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away.");

showDialogue("", "However, I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let Sayori catch up to me.");

setCharacterExpression("s", "4r");

setCharacterExpression("s", "2q");

showDialogue(playerName, "Y-You too, Monika.");

setCharacterExpression("s", "4x");
showDialogue("Sayori", "Come sit down, [player]! We made room for you at the table, so you can sit next to me or Monika.");

showDialogue("", "The girls have a few desks arranged to form a table.");

showDialogue("", "As Sayori mentioned, it's been widened so that there is one space next to Monika and one space next to Sayori.");

showDialogue("", "Natsuki and Yuri walk over to the corner of the room, where Natsuki grabs a wrapped tray and Yuri opens the closet.");

showDialogue("", "Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Sayori.");

setCharacterExpression("s", "4m");
showDialogue("Sayori", "Uwooooah!");

showDialogue("", "Natsuki lifts the foil off the tray to reveal a dozen white, fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats.");

showDialogue("", "The whiskers are drawn with icing, and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears.");

setCharacterExpression("s", "4r");
showDialogue("Sayori", "So cuuuute~!");

setCharacterExpression("m", "2b");
showDialogue("Monika", "I had no idea you were so good at baking, Natsuki!");

setCharacterExpression("n", "2d");

showDialogue("Natsuki", "Just hurry and take one!");

showDialogue("", "Sayori grabs one first, then Monika. I follow.");

setCharacterExpression("s", "4q");
showDialogue("Sayori", "It's delicious!");

showDialogue("", "Sayori talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face.");

setCharacterExpression("n", "12c");

showDialogue("Natsuki", "But not for, y-you know, {i}you!{/i} Dummy...");

showDialogue(playerName, "Alright, alright...");

showDialogue("Yuri", "Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission.");

showDialogue("Yuri", "After all, doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book?");

showDialogue(playerName, "Ah... I-I guess...");

setCharacterExpression("m", "4a");
showDialogue("Monika", "Ehehe, don't let yourself get intimidated, Yuri's just trying to impress you.");

setCharacterExpression("y", "3n");
showDialogue("Yuri", "Eh?! T-That's not...");

showDialogue("", "Insulted, Yuri looks away.");

setCharacterExpression("y", "4b");
showDialogue("Yuri", "I meant that, you know...");

showDialogue(playerName, "I believe you.");

showDialogue(playerName, "Well, tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea.");

setCharacterExpression("y", "2u");
showDialogue("Yuri", "I'm glad...");

showDialogue("", "Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief.");

showDialogue("", "Monika raises an eyebrow, then smiles at me.");

setCharacterExpression("m", "1");
showDialogue("Monika", "So, what made you consider the Literature Club?");

showDialogue(playerName, "Um...");

showDialogue("", "I was afraid of this question.");

showDialogue("", "Something tells me I shouldn't tell Monika that I was practically dragged here by Sayori.");

showDialogue(playerName, "Well, I haven't joined any clubs yet, and Sayori seemed really happy here, so...");

setCharacterExpression("m", "1j");
showDialogue("Monika", "That's okay! Don't be embarrassed!");

setCharacterExpression("m", "1b");
showDialogue("Monika", "We'll make sure you feel right at home, okay?");

showDialogue("Monika", "As president of the Literature Club, it's my duty to make the club fun and exciting for everyone!");

showDialogue(playerName, "Monika, I'm surprised.");

showDialogue(playerName, "How come you decided to start your own club?");

showDialogue(playerName, "You could probably be a board member for any of the major clubs.");

showDialogue(playerName, "Weren't you a leader of the debate club last year?");

setCharacterExpression("m", "5");
showDialogue("Monika", "Ahaha, well, you know...");

showDialogue("Monika", "To be honest, I can't stand all of the politics around the major clubs.");

showDialogue("Monika", "It feels like nothing but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events...");

showDialogue("Monika", "I'd much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special out of it.");

setCharacterExpression("m", "1b");
showDialogue("Monika", "And if it encourages others to get into literature, then I'm fulfilling that dream!");

setCharacterExpression("s", "3q");
showDialogue("Sayori", "Monika really is a great leader!");

showDialogue("", "Yuri also nods in agreement.");

showDialogue(playerName, "Then I'm surprised there aren't more people in the club yet.");

showDialogue(playerName, "It must be hard to start a new club.");

setCharacterExpression("m", "3b");
showDialogue("Monika", "You could put it that way.");

showDialogue("Monika", "Not many people are very interested in putting out all the effort to start something brand new...");

showDialogue("Monika", "Especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention, like literature.");

showDialogue("Monika", "You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile.");

showDialogue("Monika", "But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important.");

setCharacterExpression("m", "2k");
showDialogue("Monika", "I'm confident that we can all really grow this club before we graduate!");

showDialogue("Monika", "Right, everyone?");

setCharacterExpression("s", "4r");
showDialogue("Sayori", "Yeah!");

setCharacterExpression("y", "1a");
showDialogue("Yuri", "We'll do our best.");

setCharacterExpression("n", "4d");
showDialogue("Natsuki", "You know it!");

showDialogue("", "Everyone enthusiastically agrees.");

showDialogue("", "Such different girls, all interested in the same goal...");

showDialogue("", "Monika must have worked really hard just to find these three.");

showDialogue("", "Maybe that's why they were all so delighted by the idea of a new member joining.");

showDialogue("", "Though I still don't really know if I can keep up with their level of enthusiasm about literature...");

setCharacterExpression("y", "1a");
showDialogue("Yuri", "So, [player], what kinds of things do you like to read?");

showDialogue(playerName, "Well... Ah...");

showDialogue("", "Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.");

showDialogue(playerName, "...Manga...");

showDialogue("", "I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking.");

setCharacterExpression("n", "1c");
showDialogue("", "Natsuki's head suddenly perks up.");

showDialogue("", "It looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet.");

setCharacterExpression("y", "3u");
showDialogue("Yuri", "N-Not much of a reader, I guess...");

showDialogue(playerName, "...Well, that can change...");

showDialogue("", "What am I saying?");

showDialogue("", "I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile.");

showDialogue(playerName, "Anyway, what about you, Yuri?");

setCharacterExpression("y", "1l");
showDialogue("Yuri", "Well, let's see...");

showDialogue("", "Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger.");

setCharacterExpression("y", "1a");
showDialogue("Yuri", "My favorites are usually novels that build deep and complex fantasy worlds.");

showDialogue("Yuri", "The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me.");

setCharacterExpression("y", "1f");
showDialogue("Yuri", "And telling a good story in such a foreign world is equally impressive.");

showDialogue("", "Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading.");

showDialogue("", "She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people.");

setCharacterExpression("y", "2m");
showDialogue("Yuri", "But you know, I like a lot of things.");

showDialogue("Yuri", "Stories with deep psychological elements usually immerse me as well.");

setCharacterExpression("y", "2a");
showDialogue("Yuri", "Isn't it amazing how a writer can so deliberately take advantage of your own lack of imagination to completely throw you for a loop?");

showDialogue("Yuri", "Anyway, I've been reading a lot of horror lately...");

showDialogue(playerName, "Ah, I read a horror book once...");

showDialogue("", "I desperately grasp something I can relate to at the minimal level.");

showDialogue("", "At this rate, Yuri might as well be having a conversation with a rock.");

setCharacterExpression("m", "1d");
showDialogue("Monika", "Really? I wouldn't have expected that, Yuri.");

showDialogue("Monika", "For someone as gentle as you...");

setCharacterExpression("y", "1a");
showDialogue("Yuri", "I guess you could say that.");

showDialogue("Yuri", "But if a story makes me think, or takes me to another world, then I really can't put it down.");

showDialogue("Yuri", "Surreal horror is often very successful at changing the way you look at the world, if only for a brief moment.");

setCharacterExpression("n", "5q");
showDialogue("Natsuki", "Ugh, I hate horror...");

setCharacterExpression("y", "1f");
showDialogue("Yuri", "Oh? Why's that?");

setCharacterExpression("n", "5c");
showDialogue("Natsuki", "Well, I just...");

setCharacterExpression("n", "5q");
showDialogue("Natsuki", "Never mind.");

setCharacterExpression("m", "1a");
showDialogue("Monika", "That's right, you usually like to write about cute things, don't you, Natsuki?");

showDialogue("Natsuki", "W-What?");

showDialogue("Natsuki", "What gives you that idea?");

setCharacterExpression("m", "3b");

showDialogue(playerName, "Natsuki, you write your own poems?");

setCharacterExpression("n", "1c");

showDialogue(playerName, "Why don't you share them sometime?");

setCharacterExpression("n", "5q");

showDialogue("Natsuki", "You wouldn't...like them...");

showDialogue(playerName, "Ah...not a very confident writer yet?");

setCharacterExpression("y", "2f");
showDialogue("Yuri", "I understand how Natsuki feels.");

showDialogue("Yuri", "Sharing that level of writing takes more than just confidence.");

setCharacterExpression("y", "2k");
showDialogue("Yuri", "The truest form of writing is writing to oneself.");

setCharacterExpression("m", "2a");
showDialogue("Monika", "Do you have writing experience too, Yuri?");

showDialogue("Monika", "Maybe if you share some of your work, you can set an example and help Natsuki feel comfortable enough to share hers.");

showDialogue(playerName, "I guess it's the same for Yuri...");

setCharacterExpression("s", "2g");

showDialogue(playerName, "Hold on...there's still one problem.");

setCharacterExpression("m", "1d");
